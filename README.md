# Counting-Point-Mutations
Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.

What is a Mutation?

A mutation is basically an error that happens during the production or replication of nucleic acid, namely DNA. Because nucleic acids are essential for biological processes, mutations tend to spread throughout the cell. Although mutations are technical errors, a very uncommon mutation may endow the cell with a useful trait. In reality, the macro consequences of evolution are the product of beneficial microscopic changes that have occurred over many generations

Solution Step:

1- Define Two DNA strings s and t, which must be of the same length. 
2- In for loop will compare every symbol between the s, and t strings.
3- if the symbol position is not the same in both strings the counter will increase.
4- Finally, the code will print the number of Mutations between sequences.
